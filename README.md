# AI Virtual Mouse

## Description
The AI Virtual Mouse is a Python-based project that enables touchless interaction with a computer through hand gestures. Using computer vision techniques, the system tracks hand movements, allowing users to control the cursor by pointing their index finger. Additionally, left-click operations are performed when the index and middle fingers touch.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning (for gesture recognition)

## How It Works
1. Hand detection: The system uses OpenCV to detect and track the user's hand in real-time.
2. Gesture recognition: Machine learning algorithms classify hand gestures to determine cursor movement and left-click actions.
3. Cursor control: Moving the index finger controls the cursor's position on the screen.
4. Left-click operation: Touching the index and middle fingers triggers a left-click action.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/ai-virtual-mouse.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage
- Ensure your webcam is connected and positioned properly.
- Run the main script.
- Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the virtual mouse.
